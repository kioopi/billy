# Basic Billyfication 

  A web-tool to add predefined overlays to images. 

  See it deployed at [billy.nodester.com](http://billy.nodester.com). 

  Editing the images happens completely in the browser using [@kangax](http://twitter.com/kangax)`s fantastic canvas-library [fabric.js](https://github.com/kangax/fabric.js). 

  The only active component on the server is a [proxy](https://github.com/kioopi/billy/blob/master/lib/imageproxy.js) to circumvent the same-origin-policy.

  This tool is supposed to make it easy to contribute to the facebook-group [The Billiam Van Kiddur Appreciation Society](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_371408514557&ap=1).
