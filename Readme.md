# Basic Billyfication 

  Basic Billyfication is an online-tool to add Classic Billy-Faces to images found on the interwebs.
  
  The purpose of doing this is to further the general billification and to aid in the development of the [The Billiam Van Kiddur Appreciation Society](https://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_371408514557&ap=1).
